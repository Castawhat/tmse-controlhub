# Taskmaster (Scouts Edition) Control Panel
This was made for an event I ran at scouts, I needed a dashboard where I could add my own sounds and control the event.
Feel free to fork, change and use my code! You will need to remove the password lock or change the password at the bottom of index.html.

# Demoing the dashboard
Default password is PUBDASH25 (All Caps)

# Adding To The Soundboard
In the JS, you will see code like this:
 {
    name: "Green Light",
    file: "https://github.com/Castawhat/taskmasterscouts-soundboard/raw/refs/heads/main/green.mp3"
  },
Simply add your sound file to your forked repo, change Castawhat to your github user and if there are new sound files, change green.mp3 to the name of your sound file.

# /cameras.html
If you don't want this, just delete the html file and the button for it in index.html. This goes for all other HTML files too. 
### (Dont delete index.html!)
